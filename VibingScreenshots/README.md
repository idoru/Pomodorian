# Vibing Screenshots

I unfortunately lost the chat (!) in which I had Claude build this app, but luckily I still have some of the screenshots from vibing. Claude Sonnet 3.7 vision understanding is pretty good, and these went a long way.

While this is effective, doing this via some sort of tool like how folks are developing webapps with browser tools / browser use and pupeteer is definitely going to be the path forward to turbocharge this sort of workflow.

Here's how they were used.

- `a.png`, `b.png`, `c.png`: I first had a strange UI issue where the layout would be wrong in different ways, depending on whether we were displaying minutes, minutes and seconds or neither. So I uploaded these 3 images and asked it to fix it.

- `okay_but_less_space_between_would_be_better.png`: Kinda like it says, I wanted less padding.

- `sunken_pie.png`: Claude's fix for the last one wasn't great. Used this one and referred to the mangenta and red markings to describe the two visual faults.

- `better_but_still_sunken.png`: got less horizontal padding, but then the widget was still shifted up. Used this one to prompt a fix for that.

- `ui_change_request.png`: used this to get a bunch of UI changes in 1 shot. Keep sections always expanded. Make changes to duration automatically take effect on restart and remove the Apply Duration button. Add a confirmation for Quit and Reset. Just use text color for play/pause glyphs instead of green/red.
